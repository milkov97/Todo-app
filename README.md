## 

This repository contains the code and resources for my TypeScript course project. In this course, I've learned TypeScript from scratch, starting with basic type safety and gradually progressing to advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features, advanced TypeScript concepts, and building a full-stack application using TypeScript.
**Course Link: [TypeScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-course/)**

## What I've learned

### Learning Objectives

- **Basic Type Safety**: Get started with TypeScript and understand the fundamental types and type safety it offers.
- **Advanced OOP Features**: Deep dive into OOP concepts such as classes, abstract classes, access modifiers, and interfaces in TypeScript.
- **Advanced TypeScript Features**: Explore advanced TypeScript features like Generics, Decorators, Totality, Type Widening, Mapped Types, and Conditional Types.
- **Full Stack Application**: Create a task management application from scratch, covering both the front-end and back-end using TypeScript.
- **Front-end Development**: Learn how to use TypeScript with React, Material UI, React Query, and Context API.
- **Back-end Development**: Use TypeScript with Node.js, Express, TypeORM, and MySQL to build the server-side of the application.

### Final Project: ToDo App

The final project for this course is a ToDo app. Here's a brief description of the project:

- **Task Management**: Create, manage, and prioritize tasks with features to set priority and status.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time task counters and server-state synchronization.
- **Front-end Technologies**: Utilize TypeScript with React, Material UI, React Query, and Context API for the front-end.
- **Back-end Technologies**: Implement the REST API with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, TypeORM, and MySQL.
